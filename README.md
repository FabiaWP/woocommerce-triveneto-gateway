## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk, this is not an official plugin nor I have anything to do with Triveneto.

This plugin is heavily based on [Davide Gullo's PgConsTriv PHP library](http://www.m4ss.net/os-open-source/payment-gateway-consorzio-triveneto-php-class/).

I just adapted his PHP wrapper for WooCommerce use.

Thanks and hope somebody finds this useful.
